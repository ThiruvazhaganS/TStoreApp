⭐️ Tstore - E-commerce Sample Project ⭐️

🚀 Showcasing iOS Development Skills with an E-commerce App Built in Swift

Tstore is an iOS e-commerce application created as a sample project to demonstrate advanced iOS development skills. The app focuses on providing an efficient, scalable, and seamless user experience. With features like category-based filtering, special offers, dynamic sorting, real-time search, and favorites, Tstore is designed to offer users an intuitive shopping experience.


🌟 Features
1️⃣ Category and Offer Filters: Easily filter products by category, with highlighted selections for enhanced visibility. Offers are dynamically applied to update the product list.

2️⃣ Special Offers Section: Display special offers like credit card promotions, enabling users to access exclusive deals and view only relevant products when an offer is applied.

3️⃣ Sort and Filter Options: Sort products by rating or price to create a personalized shopping experience.
